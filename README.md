# Inventory Buy Plan Dashboard (Excel) — ABC + Risk Mix

## Overview
Built an Excel dashboard to support inventory buy planning using ABC segmentation and risk indicators.

## What I built
- ABC Mix (% of SKUs)
- Inventory Value by ABC
- Weeks of Supply by ABC
- Stockout Risk mix (YES vs NO) by ABC (100% stacked)
- Excess Risk mix (YES vs NO) by ABC (100% stacked)
